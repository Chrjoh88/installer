FAQs:

What does the install.sh do ?

The installer will move the chkdup.php to /opt/ then will create a symbolic link in /usr/bin/.
What about the uninstall.sh ?

The uninstaller will remove the following files:
install.sh
/opt/chkdup.php
/usr/bin/chkdup
itself "uninstall.sh"
Is it safe to use chkdup ?

Yes it is, since it takes a backup of the current sources.list before attempting to do anything. But I'm not responsible if anything happened. The full responsibility will be yours.
